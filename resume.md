## Intro
My work mentality is simple: Leave any project I start better than the way I found it. I don't settle for simply a working project or one that doesn't reciprocate the time and effort that was put into it. I want to show elegant design that pushes the user to see more than what they think. I also strive to write effective code that makes the most out of the power of the project. Whether it is in a group environment or by myself, I dedicate myself to the end goal, leaving a satisfying result for all to enjoy.
